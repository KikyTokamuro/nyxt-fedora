# Nyxt package for Fedora

[Nyxt](https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/) [n√Ωkst] is a keyboard-driven web browser designed for hackers. Inspired by Emacs and Vim, it has familiar keybindings (Emacs, vi, CUA), and is infinitely extensible in Lisp.

This repository is used to generate the Copr repo [kiky-tokamuro/Nyxt](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/kiky-tokamuro/Nyxt/).

To install, first enable the repository
```
dnf copr enable kiky-tokamuro/Nyxt 
```

and then install the package itself by running
```
sudo dnf install nyxt
```
